# CS50 EduPlatform Discussion Forum
#### _Video Demo:  <URL HERE>_
#### Description:

CS50 EduPlatform is an open online discussion forum that let students post their questions and concerns of various subject fields. For each forum post, other multiple students can reply and give answer to the post. Each student will need to create their own account and once registerd, they will be able to create new posts and participate in the discussion. Asking questions, receiving responses, and obtaining knowledge may all be done quickly, easily, and readily by posting on a discussion forum. The entry requirements are substantially lower than they would be for a phone call to customer care. You may remove a barrier for students all over the world to express their thoughts and ask questions by simply providing a discussion forum or question-and-answer section. Many students may not want to make the typical phone call. As a result, through digital tools like discussion forums and question-and-answer forums as part of a company's online community experience, more concerns are resolved and higher brand trust is developed.
